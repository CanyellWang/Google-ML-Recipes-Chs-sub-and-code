4
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:08,130
LAURENCE MORONEY: Today
I'm in the Big Apple

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,720
meeting with Josh
Gordon from Google

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,360
to talk about machine
learning, where

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,310
we will dig into how it
works, why it's important,

8
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,437
and where you can
learn all about it.

9
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:19,520
Welcome to Coffee with a
Googler in New York City.

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm Laurence Moroney,
and I'm here today

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,500
speaking with Joshua Gordon.

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,180
Now, it's something
that a lot of people

13
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,179
don't really understand
what machine learning is

14
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:28,114
in a concrete manner.

15
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:29,530
JOSHUA GORDON: So
machine learning

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,500
is all about learning
from examples

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,969
rather than writing
manual rules.

18
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,009
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

19
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,510
JOSHUA GORDON: So the
short way of saying

20
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,230
that is regular programming is
you write a lot of manual rules

21
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,170
to solve a problem.

22
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:41,210
In machine learning,
you let the algorithm

23
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,269
find those rules for you.

24
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:43,310
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

25
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,310
JOSHUA GORDON: From examples.

26
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:45,200
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So pattern matching.

27
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
It might be visual, or it
might be other patterns

28
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,060
that are hidden in data.

29
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,060
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

30
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,406
And so the input to machine-- so
the beauty of machine learning,

31
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:54,170
and the real secret sauce,
is that an algorithm that

32
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,760
learns patterns from
data can solve thousands

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,850
of different problems.

34
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,266
And the reason is if I write
a Python program to recognize

35
00:01:01,266 --> 00:01:03,509
digits, my program is hard
coded to work with digits.

36
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,550
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

37
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:07,049
JOSHUA GORDON: But if I write
an algorithm to learn patterns

38
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,520
from data, I can use that
for speech recognition, image

39
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,470
recognition, medicine.

40
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:14,010
Basically, anything that
you can start with examples,

41
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,880
just tell apart A and B, my
same algorithm that I wrote just

42
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,380
once can tackle
all these problems.

43
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,049
And that's a really special and
actually fairly profound thing.

44
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,010
LAURENCE MORONEY: Absolutely.

45
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,093
Now, one of the things in
your classes that you're

46
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,500
talking about that you're
starting with language.

47
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,260
You're starting with
Java and Python,

48
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,260
I think it was, that you said?

49
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,590
JOSHUA GORDON: Yes, absolutely.

50
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,590
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So how's the class

51
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:33,700
going to be
structured for people

52
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,330
who want to be these data
scientists of the future?

53
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,330
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

54
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,950
So first of all, there
are zero prerequisites.

55
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,380
Well, that's not true.

56
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,090
There's one prerequisite.

57
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:39,090
LAURENCE MORONEY: My favorite.

58
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,209
Oh, OK.

59
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,376
Well, what's the one prereq?

60
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:44,500
JOSHUA GORDON: Basic programming
ability in Java or Python.

61
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,230
And by basic, I mean you can run
scripts and you can tweak them.

62
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,770
That's it.

63
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,440
A little bit of
high school math.

64
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,450
And that means like basic
algebra, basic geometry.

65
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,470
When I say basic geometry,
to be totally honest,

66
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,447
if you asked me, like,
what sine and cosine,

67
00:01:58,447 --> 00:01:59,530
I would have to Google it.

68
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,510
I don't remember, honestly.

69
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:04,419
So just basic familiarity,
and that's it.

70
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,459
And we're going to teach
the class in three ways.

71
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,030
We're going to teach it
totally from the ground up.

72
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,205
So one problem I had with some
of the academic classes I took

73
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:14,080
is that they'll talk
about a fancy algorithm,

74
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,149
like neural
networks, but they'll

75
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:17,440
talk about it in terms of math.

76
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,120
And so at the end of the class,
I don't know how to build that.

77
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,107
I can't really do it.

78
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:22,440
We're doing it in a reverse way.

79
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
We're building it step
by step, and we're

80
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,744
explaining only the math that's
really necessary as we go.

81
00:02:27,744 --> 00:02:30,160
And instead of equations, we're
going use visual examples.

82
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,160
LAURENCE MORONEY: Perfect.

83
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:32,187
JOSHUA GORDON: So
an equation could

84
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,060
be like if you talk
about gradient descent,

85
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,259
gradient descent
basically means finding

86
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,883
the minimum of a function.

87
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:40,550
So if I just say that, like as a
developer, I'm like, all right,

88
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,160
what does that mean?

89
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,535
So you can think
of any equation,

90
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:45,550
like x cubed plus y squared
plus whatever equals 7.

91
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,250
There's some value of x and y.

92
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,660
LAURENCE MORONEY: That's going
to be the bottom of that curve,

93
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:48,660
right?

94
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,270
JOSHUA GORDON: Or not equals 7.

95
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,020
Equals some value.

96
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Right.

97
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,720
Anyway, you can find
the bottom of that curve

98
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,069
literally by thinking as a bowl.

99
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,270
You can drop a piece
of fruit in a bowl

100
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,715
and it will roll to the bottom.

101
00:02:57,715 --> 00:02:59,340
And gradient descent
just means finding

102
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,960
where this function is 0.

103
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,009
And you can actually
describe that really simply

104
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:05,280
in only like 10 or
12 lines of Python,

105
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,585
actually, instead of
five slides of equations.

106
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,210
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I think it's also

107
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,300
important to understand
why you need to find

108
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,300
the bottom of the curve.

109
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,340
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

110
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,919
LAURENCE MORONEY: And just
focus on that example.

111
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:15,330
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

112
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,419
So that's difficult
to describe concisely.

113
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:19,076
LAURENCE MORONEY: Right.

114
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:20,660
JOSHUA GORDON: So
in machine learning,

115
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,349
let's say you're
writing an algorithm.

116
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,240
Let's say it's to distinguish
apples from oranges.

117
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,199
You always want to know, how
accurate is my algorithm?

118
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,090
Like, I can solve that
problem in one line.

119
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,020
I can just say,
return math.random.

120
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,389
So one line, math.random.

121
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,389
LAURENCE MORONEY: That
would be the perfect one.

122
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,084
JOSHUA GORDON: My
accuracy is crap.

123
00:03:39,084 --> 00:03:40,000
LAURENCE MORONEY: 50%.

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,000
JOSHUA GORDON: Right.

125
00:03:40,874 --> 00:03:42,160
Yeah, it's 50%.

126
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,190
LAURENCE MORONEY: Between
an apple and an orange.

127
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,630
JOSHUA GORDON: It's a one liner.

128
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,186
But really, we want
to get-- another way

129
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,810
of describing accuracy
is you can think

130
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,690
about it n terms of error.

131
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,120
High accuracy means low error.

132
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,550
And you can have an equation
that describes your error.

133
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,569
And the minimum of
that equation is

134
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,741
going to give you
the highest accuracy.

135
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,740
So you can write your
machine learning algorithm

136
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:06,299
to try and minimize the equation
that describes the error.

137
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:07,340
LAURENCE MORONEY: Got it.

138
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,120
JOSHUA GORDON: And we'll
make that super concrete

139
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,319
in the class, but that's
where minimization comes in

140
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,669
and that's where gradient
descent comes in.

141
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,319
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So one of the things

142
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,735
you're saying in
the class, you're

143
00:04:14,735 --> 00:04:16,485
teaching just a pure
Java, Python version.

144
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,110
But there's also a
version where you're

145
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,490
bringing in
preexisting libraries

146
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,720
that have come from academia.

147
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:20,720
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

148
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,259
LAURENCE MORONEY: That will
solve a lot of this for you,

149
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:22,259
right?

150
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:23,230
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

151
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,562
So I want to do a couple things.

152
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:27,009
One is I want to
provide the TLDR.

153
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:29,720
So honestly, as a
developer, I like to get up

154
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,089
and running really fast.

155
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:34,632
So we're also going to use
open source libraries from just

156
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:35,589
different universities.

157
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:37,990
There's one in New Zealand
that I really love.

158
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,509
We're going to you how to build,
basically first, everything

159
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:42,384
from the ground up step
by step from scratch.

160
00:04:42,384 --> 00:04:45,730
And the reason we do that is
because it keeps us honest.

161
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,250
If you build every
single piece, you

162
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,560
have some understanding
of every single piece.

163
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,139
LAURENCE MORONEY: And if
you're relying on somebody else

164
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,329
having done the work, you don't
fully get to understand it

165
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:54,329
yourself.

166
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,500
JOSHUA GORDON: Exactly.

167
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,750
Now, another thing is using
the open source libraries,

168
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,329
honestly, you can solve
probably 80% or 90%

169
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,389
of the machine learning problems
you would as a data scientist.

170
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,509
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice.

171
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,800
JOSHUA GORDON: Now, when you
get to the really gigantic

172
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,471
problems, then really it
makes sense to use the cloud.

173
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:11,180
So we're also going
to teach how to solve

174
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,470
problems using Google APIs.

175
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,529
But that's at the
very end of the class,

176
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,345
and it's totally optional.

177
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:17,519
LAURENCE MORONEY: This
is all on YouTube, right?

178
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,769
JOSHUA GORDON: All on YouTube.

179
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:21,500
There might be some ads on
it, but that's literally it.

180
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,230
We think it's going
to be awesome.

181
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,410
LAURENCE MORONEY: Like
source code and stuff

182
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,410
that you've done?

183
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,800
JOSHUA GORDON: The source
code will be on GitHub.

184
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,569
LAURENCE MORONEY:
It's all on GitHub.

185
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:26,569
Perfect.

186
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,069
JOSHUA GORDON: It
will all be on GitHub.

187
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,019
And the reason I
was hesitating is

188
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,644
I'm writing all this
as we're speaking,

189
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:30,819
so I'm totally exhausted.

190
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:32,699
But yes, it's totally,
100% out there.

191
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,389
LAURENCE MORONEY: Well, you're
still looking energetic to me.

192
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:38,386
JOSHUA GORDON: I've had a
lot of coffee with a Googler.

193
00:05:38,386 --> 00:05:39,399
Good for you.

194
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,774
LAURENCE MORONEY:
Well, I for one

195
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:42,483
am really looking
forward to this course.

196
00:05:42,483 --> 00:05:45,709
I'm looking forward to learning
what you have to teach.

197
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:47,269
I've had the same
kind of struggles

198
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:50,096
as you in trying to understand
the math behind this

199
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,470
and why I'm doing
the math, which

200
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,360
is why I had those
pointed questions earlier.

201
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,139
JOSHUA GORDON: Absolutely.

202
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:54,139
LAURENCE MORONEY:
So thanks, Josh.

203
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,029
That was a whole lot of fun.

204
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:57,814
And I've learned so
much about machine

205
00:05:57,814 --> 00:05:59,730
learning just from these
few minutes with you,

206
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,410
so I'm really looking
forward to your class.

207
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:01,410
JOSHUA GORDON: Thanks so much.

208
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,550
LAURENCE MORONEY: If you've
enjoyed this episode of Coffee

want to learn machine learning

210
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,694
for yourself, if you have
any questions for Joshua,

211
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,110

218
00:06:17,521 --> 00:06:19,730
JOSHUA GORDON: You really
can learn machine learning,

219
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,949
and it's faster and
easier than you think.

220
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:25,540
We've gone through a ton of
classes, textbooks, and blog

221
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,120
posts to bring you the clearest
and most concise explanations

222
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,459
of the hard concepts.

223
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:32,024
We really think you're going
to be able to learn it and have

224
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,290
some fun on the way.
